Whilst still in early development, & whilst there is not a lot of functionality, to run the code change to the project dir, i.e. the location of this README file then execute the following:

Setup the VirtualEnv
====================
Decide where you want to store your virtualenv. I use a hidden (dotfile) alongside my project repo, so if moot is stored in the projects/moot then the virtualenv is in projects/.moot

You can now create a virtualenv for moot using:

    $ virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute .moot && source .moot/bin/activate && pip install -r moot/requirements.txt

Run the Code
============
To run the Test Suite:

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src python test/test_dgdl.py


Currently there is only some setup & tear down code in main that instantiates some of the basic DGDL classes, at least until the CLI has been implemented. To run the "in development" application:

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src python src/main.py

Even better, export the moot src dir onto your PYTHONPATH. Assuming that you are in the moot project root dir:

    $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src

You should now be able to execute:

    $ python test/test_dgdl.py

& see the output from the unittests.


Documentation
=============
The latest version of the documentation is built and stored at
    http://moot.readthedocs.org

If you want to build the documentation yourself, first we must ensure that we have the latest ReSt files built from our Python source using sphinx-apidoc. In the project's root directory:

    $ sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/modules src/

Now ask sphinx to build the HTML (or other output format). In the docs directory, execute:
    
    $ make html
    
Your should now be able to find your documentation in the docs/build/html directory
