Whilst still in early development, & whilst there is not a lot of functionality, to run the code change to the project dir, i.e. the location of this README file then execute the following:


To run the Test Suite:

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src python test/test_dgdl.py


Currently there is only some setup & tear down code in main that instantiates some of the basic DGDL classes, at least until the CLI has been implemented. To run the "in development" application:

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src python src/main.py


To build the documentation, first create the ReSt files from our Python source using sphinx-apidoc. In the root project directory:

    $ sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source src/

Now ask sphinx to build the HTML (or other output). In the docs directory:
    
    $ make html
